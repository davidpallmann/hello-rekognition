# Hello, Rekognition!

This is the code project for the [Hello, Rekognition!](https://davidpallmann.hashnode.dev/hello-rekognition) blog post. 

This episode: Amazon Rekognition and Computer Vision. In this Hello, Cloud blog series, we're covering the basics of AWS cloud services for newcomers who are .NET developers. If you love C# but are new to AWS, or to this particular service, this should give you a jumpstart.

In this post we'll introduce Amazon Rekognition and use it in a "Hello, Cloud" .NET program to recognize images. We'll do this step-by-step, making no assumptions other than familiarity with C# and Visual Studio. We're using Visual Studio 2022 and .NET 6.

## Our Hello, Rekognition Project

Weâ€™re going to first try out Amazon Rekognition through the AWS console to try out its capabilities. Then, we'll create a .NET 6 console program and use it feed images to Rekognition for a variety of analysis actions, including label detection, image moderation, celebrity face recognition, and face detection. For face detection, we'll also make a copy of the original image with highlighting of the detected faces.

See the blog post for the tutorial to create this project and run it on AWS.
